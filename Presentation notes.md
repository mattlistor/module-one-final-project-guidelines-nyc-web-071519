# WELCOME TO OUR BOOKSTORE DATABASE

# WALK THROUGH THE APPLICATION
-Faker
-Hard coding books vs. Randomly generating books
-Test out everything in the application

# TALK ABOUT RECOMMENDATION METHOD

-Walk through the recommendation method and talk about the struggles therein

# THINGS I LEARNED 
 
1. Helper methods are your best friend when dealing with lots of code
2. You must use ActiveRecord methods to successfully update a row in your database
3. When working in CLI apps, it is much easier to use numbers to input your next action
   and then use case methods to navigate through the application

#THINGS I WOULD ADD/CHANGE

-Add the option to recommend books by favorite author OR favorite genre
-Maybe add a 'cart' function where you put books in a cart and then order them 
 all at once when you 'checkout'
-We used too much ruby and I wish we used more ActiveRecord methods instead of enumerables
-Number each book in the inventory so you wouldn't have to type in the title when ordering
